# CSS3 Progress Bars for Rails

## Inspiration

[Josh Sullivan][js] made some very pretty [progress bars][blog] in CSS3.

[I][vanity] wrote some helper methods for Rails to generate the HTML for the progress bars.

Thought it might be useful.

## Instruction

This gem assumes you're using Rails 3.1+, including the asset pipeline.

Into the Gemfile:  
    
    gem 'css3-progress-bar-rails'

Into the application.css header:

    *= require 'css3-progress-bar'
